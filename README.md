# Introduction to Predictive Modeling in R
This is solid workshop that can be both taught as a stand-alone workshop or as part of the R track on the digital institutes.

## Credits
This workshop was written by [Yuxiao Luo](https://github.com/YuxiaoLuo) and adapted from a wonderful R workshop by [Víctor Peña](https://github.com/VicPena).

## Workshops
The [Introduction to R & RStudio](https://github.com/YuxiaoLuo/PredictiveModeling/blob/main/IntroR.R) (adapted from [Intro to R Workshop](https://github.com/GC-DRI/R)) is a preliminary workshop for predictive modeling in R and was first taught at CUNY GCDI by Yuxiao Luo on 10/01/2021 as a 1.5 hours online synchronous workshop.

The first part [PreModWorkshop1.R](https://github.com/YuxiaoLuo/PredictiveModeling/blob/main/PreModWorkshop1.R) was first taught at CUNY GCDI by Yuxiao Luo on 03/19/2021 as a two hour online synchronous workshop.

Abstract:

> In this workshop, we will learn the basics of supervised learning (predictive models), including regression (predictive continuous outcomes) and classification (predicting 
> categorical outcomes. We will go through the modeling pipeline, including data pre-processing, model fitting, and performance assessment. Some introductory R knowledge is 
> necessary. As we don't have time to go over the basics durin the workshop, you can go to another GCDI R workshop (https://github.com/GC-DRI/R) and pick up the basic R in 2-3 
> hours before coming to this one. For the 1st part, the R script is `PreModWorkshop1.R` and dataset is stored in the folder `data`. The tutorial markdown file is 
> `PreModWorkshop.md`.

## Requirements
- Students need to be familiar with R. We should suggest them to take the [Intro to R workshop](https://github.com/GC-DRI/R) first.
- Students should install R and Rstudio on their computers following this [installation instruction](https://github.com/GC-DRI/install/blob/master/sections/R.md).
  - Aternatively, students can use RStudio Cloud, which runs in the browser and require no installation. 
- It would benefit students if they came to this workshop with some basic notions of how RStduio works. Any 5-10 minute long tutorial on youtube should be enough for that. Whoever is leading the workshop should give them the link.

## Reception and Feedback
The first Predictive Modeling workshop receives positive feedback and students have interests in it. More feedback will be collected and summarized here in the future.

## Needed/Desired Changes
The current version of the Predictive Modeling workshop has no challenges/exercises. May add some in the future.
